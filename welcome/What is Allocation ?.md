# What are the Benefits of Fixed Swap Pools?

Before you can participate in a token offering on Seedling or any other launchpad, you will have to obtain an allocation in the upcoming sale. An allocation is something akin to a ticket that allows you a maximum amount of investment in an upcoming token sale. This is done to prevent a single, or a limited number of entities from front-running a listing and purchasing the entire pool outright, leaving no tokens for other investors who might be interested in participating.

This is the reason why all Launchpads adopt some form of allocation system, so that no single or concentrated number of individuals can have access to the entire pool. Investors of Launchpads are usually required to lock an amount of the Launchpad’s token in order to receive an allocation, however, each Launchpad differs in terms of its system for calculating allocation.


**Seedling’s Allocation System**
Seedling adopts a more unique approach to its allocation algorithm, by having a tier-less system. This essentially means that investors receive an allocation directly proportional to the number of Seedling Tokens ($SDLN) they lock or burn, removing the need to lock a specified minimum amount of tokens – which is found in tiered allocation systems – while counting each and every SDLN token into the final allocation. This allows investors to lock however many or few SDLN tokens they want, and receive an allocation proportional to that; allowing for more flexible ticket sizes for token offerings.

**Ways to Obtain Allocation**
There are two ways of obtaining allocation on Seedling, Locking and Burning $SDLN.

**Locking**: $SDLN Holders can choose to lock their tokens from 1 of 4 durations on Seedling’s Locking Portal to receive an allocation. The longer the duration, the larger the multiplier on the allocation received. I.e. those who lock their $SDLN for 1 month receive a monthly allocation equivalent to 8X the value of their $SDLN locked, while those who lock for 12 months will have a multiplier of 16X. Do keep in mind that the allocation is distributed linearly, so investors have to lock their tokens early to accumulate allocation for future token offerings.

**Burning**: $SDLN Holders can also choose to burn their tokens on Seedling’s Locking Portal to receive a one-time allocation top-up, equivalent to 50X the value of the tokens burned. Tokens burnt will be put out of circulation indefinitely, leading to deflationary pressure if tokens are frequently burned. Investors may choose to do this if they do not have enough $SDLN locked by the time a token pool launches, leaving them with not enough time to accumulate allocation by locking tokens.
