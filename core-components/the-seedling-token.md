## Token Utility <a href="#642d" id="642d"></a>

Via our launchpad platform, members of our community are provided secure access to sales of blockchain projects that are trusted and have been vetted by our team. Through a tiered system, holders of the $SDLN token gain guaranteed allocation to seed rounds, presales, and public sales of projects launching through our platform.

By establishing individual caps, and a fair distribution system, Seedling protects our community backers from the risk of presale dumps. Our goal is to provide projects with a sustainable growth path, and prevent retail investors from being burned by whales selling for early profit as soon as projects hit an exchange.

> Stake $SDLN to unlock better valuations and gain priority over other investors.
