## Token Utility <a href="#642d" id="642d"></a>

Via our launchpad platform, members of our community are provided secure access to sales of blockchain projects that are trusted and have been vetted by our team.
Through our tier-less allocation system, holders of the SDLN token are able to lock or burn their SDLN tokens to obtain allocation, which they can use in future seed, private, and public sales of projects launching through our platform. You can find more information on our allocation system in the section on [investment-allocations.md](investment-allocations.md "mention").

By establishing individual caps, and a fair distribution system, Seedling protects our community backers from the risk of presale dumps. Our goal is to provide projects with a sustainable growth path, and prevent retail investors from being burned by whales selling for early profit as soon as projects hit an exchange.

> Stake $SDLN to unlock better valuations and gain priority over other investors.
