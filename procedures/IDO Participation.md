### Investing in a Token Offering

Next, we’ll be showing you how to invest in a project on our platform. Before investing, make sure you have burned or locked $SDLN to get allocation, more info can be found here.

**Step 1: Registering Interest**

Before you can invest in a project, you will first have to register your interest in the project. This can be done at any time, even after the token offering has started.
Head on to Seedling’s website and look for the project you’re interested in.
Click “Register Interest” in the project you’re interested in. You’ll then be prompted to sign a transaction in your wallet.
You will now be able to invest in that project once the token offering starts.

**Step 2: Investing in a project**

Once you have registered your interest, you will now be able to invest in a project using **stablecoins**. Make sure you are on the **Binance Smart Chain Network** before moving on with the next step.
Before investing, you should also read through our Analysis Report to find out more information about the project such as its Tokenomics, Vesting, Token Network, Team, and Roadmap. You can do this by clicking the “Download” Button next to “Seedling Analysis”.
After you’re ready to invest, click on the **“Contribute” button**.
Next, select the type and amount of stablecoin you would like to contribute. You will be able to enter any amount between your minimum and maximum allocation.
Hit **“Pay”** and sign the transaction on your wallet. After a while, your investment should show on the token offering page.
With that, you have successfully invested in the project. Make sure to join our Telegram to get notified about future token offerings as well as updates on the project you invested in (such as listing, vesting, etc).
