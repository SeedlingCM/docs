## Introducing Seedling

Seedling is a platform for retail venture investing in equity and tokens. Providing low-risk participation frameworks is essential to reach global retail in venture capital, as most retail investors cannot afford to risk large portions of their money. By providing an opportunity to everyday people to safely grow their own capital, we aim to improve the quality of millions of lives while simultaneously enabling a new funding source for innovation worldwide.

We have created a platform that incorporates pluggable solutions to the problems early-stage ventures face after fundraising, alongside creating venture investment structures that make participation far safer for retail.

### How does Seedling relate to [Cherry Network](https://cherry.network)?

[Cherry Network ](https://cherry.network)is an exciting new blockchain infrastructure. Since its inception, [Cherry ](https://cherry.network)has seen a huge demand from projects to build on its stack. This is why we are creating Seedling as a permissionless, self-managed launchpad to enable new projects to raise funds. Seedling aims to help and promote projects building on [Cherry](https://cherry.network), but also in the crypto ecosystem as a whole.

### **How can projects use Seedling?**

The platform allows cryptocurrency projects to raise funds by setting up a swap pool based on a fixed purchase rate for tokens. These so called “Fixed Swap Pools” have many advantages for token sale investors over traditional fundraising models like ICOs, IEOs and IDOs (Initial DEX Offerings). Fixed Swap Pools will maintain the token price throughout the sale until the initial supply is bought.

With Seedling, decentralized projects will be able to raise and exchange capital cheap and fast. Users will be able to participate in a secure and compliant environment and to use assets that go way beyond the current ERC20 standard.

### **What are Seedling's use cases?**

Startups and projects can raise funds on Seedling's interoperable and decentralized infrastructure.

This technology can also have other applications outside of fundraising, such as;

* Closed OTC deals with password protection
* Discounted sales with whitelisted addresses
* Token pools will include dutch and sealed-bid auctions
* Crowdfunding
